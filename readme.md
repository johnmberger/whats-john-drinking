# What's John Drinking?

I got sick of the [Untappd](https://untappd.com/) UI, so I built my own site to track the beer I've been drinking. Coupled with a [custom node proxy server](https://github.com/johnmberger/beer-proxy), this little app consumes the Untappd API.

Currently, this shows the feed of beers I've checked into Untappd, my top 10 rated beers, and some relatively simple data visualizations about my drinking habits. I hope to add more categories in the future.

There's more to come, so stay tuned!
