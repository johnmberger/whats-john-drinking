# What's John Drinking?

I got sick of the [Untappd](https://untappd.com/) UI, so I built my own site to track the beer I've been drinking.

The ultimate goal here is to have a really badass visualization of all the stats about my beer drinking habits, but first I need to learn Chart.js or D3.js ...

Stay tuned!
